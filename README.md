## Lessons Learned
During the creation of this program I initially struggled with the logic required to differentiate between the dealers cards and the players cards.  I also had issues with determining a winner and ending the game.  I used a do/while loop, along with a boolean to determine if either the player or dealer had "busted", to accomplish this. I also learned to better use not only the resources given to me but others that are freely available online.  I would still like to work on the logic for instant Blackjack and see if I can make the code more "DRY" using less if statements.
